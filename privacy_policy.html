This Privacy Policy explains how NEXTONE CODES PVT LTD ("we" or "us") collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information obtained from users ("you" or "users") of our Android mobile application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<br>
<h3>1.1 Device ID:</h3>When you use the App, we may collect your device's unique identifier, such as the Android Advertising ID (AAID) or the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. This information is collected to provide you with a personalized experience and to improve the functionality of the App.
<br><br>
<h3>1.2 Location Information:</h3> With your consent, we may collect and process information about your device's location. This information is collected to provide location-based services within the App, such as finding nearby points of interest or providing relevant content based on your location.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<br>
<h3>2.1 Device ID:</h3> We use your device ID to uniquely identify your device and associate it with your user account. This allows us to provide personalized features and services, such as remembering your preferences and settings.
<br><br>
<h3>2.2 Location Information:</h3> We use your location information to offer location-based services and enhance your user experience. This may include displaying relevant content based on your current location or providing directions to nearby places of interest.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<br>
3.1 We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as described in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
3.2 We may share your device ID and location information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App, analyzing usage patterns, or delivering personalized content. These service providers are contractually bound to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information and are prohibited from using it for any other purposes.
<br><br>
3.3 We may disclose your personal information if required by law or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<br>
4.1 We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the personal information collected through the App. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<br><br>
<h3>5.1 Device ID: </h3>You can reset or limit the use of your device ID by adjusting the settings on your device. However, please note that this may affect the functionality and personalized features of the App.
<br><br>
<h3>5.2 Location Information:</h3> You can control and manage the location permissions granted to the App through your device settings. If you disable location services, certain features of the App that rely on location information may not function properly.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<br>
6.1 The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<br><br>
7.1 We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.
